=Alcohol, other drugs, and gambling=

It is widely believed that Islam forbids alcohol, but its ancient texts only expressly forbid ''khamr,'' an ancient wine made from dates and grapes. Alongside ''khamr,'' ancient texts forbid gambling. The view that Islam forbids drinking entirely is incompatible with guidance available within Islamic texts about how to reduce harms related to alcohol consumption. Texts offer little guidance about drugs other than alcohol.   

== Overview ==

=== The three phases of prohibition ===
During the early years of Islam's formation, ''khamr,'' a wine made from dates and grapes, and gambling were forbidden in three escalating phases, which were understood as revelations from Allah. The Quran recounts these phases:

# First, it was advised that adherents avoid ''khamr'' and gambling.
# Next, adherents were forbidden from appearing at public prayer while intoxicated.
# Finally, ''khamr'' was forbidden altogether. 
The stated reason for the first phase was because the benefits of ''khamr'' and gambling were outweighed by their harms. For the second phase was it was reasoned that, when intoxicated, people do not necessarily know what they are saying, and prayer must be performed with knowledge of what it means.  

Because adherents were advised to pray ''(salat)'' several times per day, those who drank at any time were liable to appear at prayer intoxicated. This liability probably motivated the outright prohibition.  

When the prohibition was enacted, the streets of Medina flowed with ''khamr.'' Centuries later, when Prohibition was enacted in the U.S., the streets of many of the country's cities flowed with beer. 

=== Intoxicants other than ''khamr'' ===
During the formation of Islam, ''khamr,'' a wine made by fermenting dates and grapes, was a highly popular intoxicant. When consulted about other intoxicants, Muhammad said "every intoxicant is ''khamr'', and every intoxicant is forbidden." However, since the source for this quote is Hadith, it is not to be understood as divine revelation, but as the opinion of a wise man.

=== Problem drinking and recovery ===
It is commonly believed in the U.S. that their historic Prohibition of alcohol was a failure because it did not prevent people from drinking. This is not quite true. The effect of U.S. Prohibition policy was that fewer people drank, but those who did drink were more likely to develop a drinking problem, and less likely to receive help for it, for fear of punishment. So, Prohibition represented a grave injustice toward those who struggled with alcohol.  

Similarly, while Muslims are less likely than non-Muslims to drink, those who drink are more likely to develop a drinking problem, and face greater challenges when seeking help. Because Alcoholics Anonymous, a 12-step fellowship, is rooted in Christian culture, an Islamic alternative, Millati Islami (meaning 'path of peace'), has been developed. Due in part to social stigma among Muslims, Milliati Islami has yet to develop a geographic reach comparable to that of Alcoholics Anonymous. It would be wise for Muslims to demonstrate compassionate non-judgment in their treatment of those who struggle with alcohol.  

=== Gambling ===
During the formation of Islam, those who drank ''khamr'' often gambled while drinking. Drinking and gambling all day is not an activity which fosters community nourishment or growth. Due to the close associations between the two activities, they were forbidden together.

Today, psychologists recognize problem gambling and Gambling Disorder as behavioral addictions. Although we are not aware of any guidance on reducing gambling harms in Islamic texts, some psychologists are working to develop such guidance.
