Installing MediaWiki
---

(on MacOS)

Starting with MediaWiki 1.2.0, it's possible to install and configure the wiki
"in-place", as long as you have the necessary prerequisites available.

Required software as of MediaWiki 1.40.0:

* Web server with PHP 7.4.3 or higher, plus the following extensions:

  To start php now and restart at login:
  brew services start php

  Not sure how that's meant to work, so do this in your wiki directory:
  php -S localhost:8000


  trying to use phpbrew as PHP package manager

  ** ctype
    phpbrew ext install ctype
    worked

  ** dom
    should be included

  ** fileinfo
    phpbrew ext install fileinfo
    worked

  ** iconv
    brew install libiconv
    phpbrew ext install iconv -- --with-iconv=$(brew --prefix libiconv)
    worked
    
  ** intl
    brew reinstall icu4c
    PKG_CONFIG_PATH=$(brew --prefix icu4c)/lib/pkgconfig phpbrew ext install intl
    worked

  ** json
    should be included

  ** libxml
    should be included

  ** mbstring
    brew install mbstring
    phpbrew ext install mbstring

  ** xml
    should be included
    
  ** xmlreader
    should be included

* A SQL server, the following types are supported
** MariaDB 10.3 or higher
  installed this one, only accepts connections from localhost by default
  brew services start mariadb

  must configure php—possibilities:
    phpbrew --debug install 8.2.0 +pdo +mysql +openssl
    (seems to have worked)

  I own the server (localhost) so need to set root password:
  sudo mysql_secure_installation (or mariadb-secure-installation if deprecated)

  then configure following instructions:
    http://localhost:8000/mw-config/index.php?page=DBConnect
    https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Installing_MediaWiki

    After putting LocalSettings.php in place, protect it:
    https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:LocalSettings.php
      chmod 600 LocalSettings.php
      (or 640 if webserver needs that)

  found out I needed to install the PHP openSSL and Zlib extensions
  phpbrew --debug install 8.2.0 +openssl
  (worked? would rather have tried something like:)
    brew install openssl
    phpbrew ext install openssl
  this created more problems. trying this:
    phpbrew --debug install 8.2.0 +pdo +mysql +openssl +zlib

  
    

** MySQL 5.7.0 or higher
** PostgreSQL 10 or higher
** SQLite 3.8.0 or higher

MediaWiki is developed and tested mainly on Unix/Linux platforms, but should
work on Windows as well.

Support for specialised content requires installing the relevant extension. For
formulæ, see https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Special:MyLanguage/Extension:Math

Don't forget to check the RELEASE-NOTES file...


Additional documentation is available online, which may include more detailed
notes on particular operating systems and workarounds for difficult hosting
environments:

******************* WARNING *******************

REMEMBER: ALWAYS BACK UP YOUR DATABASE BEFORE
ATTEMPTING TO INSTALL OR UPGRADE!!!

******************* WARNING *******************

----
In-place web install
----

Decompress the MediaWiki installation archive either on your server, or on your
local machine and upload the directory tree. Rename it from "mediawiki-1.x.x" to
something nice, like "wiki", since it will be appearing in your URL,
ie. /wiki/index.php/Article.

  +--------------------------------------------------------------------------+
  |  Note: If you plan to use a fancy URL-rewriting scheme to prettify your  |
  |  URLs, such as http://www.example.com/wiki/Article, you should put the   |
  |  files in a *different* directory from the virtual path where page names |
  |  will appear. It is common in this case to use w as the folder name and  |
  |  /wiki/ as the virtual article path where your articles pretend to be.   |
  |                                                                          |
  |  See: https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Special:MyLanguage/Manual:Short_URL |
  +--------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Hop into your browser and surf into the wiki directory. It'll direct you into
the config script. Fill out the form... remember you're probably not on an
encrypted connection.
Gaaah! :)

If all goes well, you should soon be told that it's set up your wiki database
and generated a configuration file. There is now a copy of "LocalSettings.php"
available to download from the installer. Download this now, there is not a
way (yet) to get it after you exit the installer. Place it in the main wiki
directory, and the wiki should now be working.

Once the wiki is set up, you should remove the mw-config directory (though it
will refuse to config again if the wiki is set up).

Don't forget that this is free software under development! Chances are good
there's a crucial step that hasn't made it into the documentation. You should
probably sign up for the MediaWiki developers' mailing list; you can ask for
help (please provide enough information to work with, and preferably be aware of
what you're doing!) and keep track of major changes to the software, including
performance improvements and security patches.
